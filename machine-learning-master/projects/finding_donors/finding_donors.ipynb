    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",

We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores.

    "__Logistic Regression__\n",
    "* ___Logistic Regression___ is optimal for binary-classification models, where the prediction (dependent, or 'label') variable is a binary nominal (`0` or `1`) typically. (It could also apply to classification values (`male` or `female`.) Thus, it is great for biomedical research in which the prediction depends on a number of independent measurements, such as whether a person is suceptible to cancer.\n",
    "* _Strengths_:\n",
    "    * It is a linear approach to classification problems;\n",
    "    * Given that it is linear, it is a linear function of parameters for estimating/prediction;\n",
    "    * It is very efficient since it does not require heavy computational energies;\n",
    "    * Since it doesn't require tuning, it can be regularized, which is easy to do with logistic regressions.\n",
    "* _Weaknesses_:\n",
    "    * It cannot solve non-linear problems since, again, it is a linear solution;\n",
    "    * It's simplicity can be its downfall when other algorithms are less efficient (relative to computational energies) but can provide more complex performance metrics;\n",
    "    * It is prone to overfitting.\n",
    "* _Candidacy_: \n",
    "    * Their are not many independent variables so the data is clean and straightforward, thus ensuring low-computational energies for a binary classification.\n",
    "    \n",
    "__GaussianNB__\n",
    "* ___GaussianNB___ is used for classification purposes, an algorithm which is heavily favored for email filtering (`span` or `not-spam`). Though there are other Naive Bayes algorithms for classifiers, GaussianNB has been utilized most often given its simplicity and well-worn history (being based on Bayes's Theorem).\n",
    "* _Strengths_:\n",
    "    * It takes into account both prior and posterior (before and after, respectively) knowledge with regards to the 'event' at hand;\n",
    "    * Its accuracy is obtained in a very fast and simple manner, lending to a low-level of computational energies;\n",
    "    * Factoring in a strong model of probability allows for flexibility with regards to independent variables being _actually_ independent (e.g., if previously assumed independent variables realistically share a relationship, the classifier still holds weight).\n",
    "* _Weaknesses_:\n",
    "    * It is prone to misclassification if the independent vaiables are insufficient; or, to put it another way, it is a _naive_ algorithm, which can by by definition sub-optimal;\n",
    "    * If data is scarce, the algorithm must fall back to likelihood measurements, building on the first weakness and possibly devaluing the 'naive' label (e.g., applying prior knowledge where none exists in the data);\n",
    "    * To counter the third strength above: Assuming features are independent of one another is not very realistic.\n",
    "* _Candidacy_:\n",
    "    * If the weaknesses are correctly accounted for, the provisional dataset is substantial enough to provide for a solid GaussianNB application.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Random Forest Ensemble Method__\n",
    "* ___RandomForestClassifier___ is an ensemble method analogous to `knn` predictors. It leverages a '20-questions' approach, understood as a divide-and-conquer method by which the prediction is arrived at with elimination via binaries (`0` or `1`) deduction. Classifying whether articles are 'evergreen' or not is done often by the Random Forest approach.\n",
    "* _Strengths_:\n",
    "    * The process-of-elimination by which this algorithm arrives at its prediction is highly tunable and exhaustive;\n",
    "    * It can easily tackle large datasets given the potential for highly tunable hyperparamenters;\n",
    "    * Since it is used in conjuction with Decision Trees, the tendency to overfit (high variance) is reduced significantly.\n",
    "* _Weaknesses_:\n",
    "    * To counter the third strength above: The dataset _must_ be large in order to compensate for overfitting;\n",
    "    * In addition, noisy data can lend to a Random Forest's overfitting if and when the data is not properly normalized or preprocessed.\n",
    "* _Candidacy_:\n",

    "During this boosting process, the weaker prediction steps are filtered for their strengths, and those strong instances of prediction (amongst the weak) are used for the next round of learning. This is repeated for either a predetermined number of steps, or if the predictions can go no further. The strong learners are used and added at every stage to the ensemble, thus ensuring an ensemble of strong learners without, ideally, any weak learners. "

    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
